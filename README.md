# Speech-vs-Non-Speech-Segmentation
Building a robust speech and non-speech segmentation model requires a careful blend of
classical and deep learning techniques. This phase focuses on developing a system that
can accurately differentiate speech from non-speech in various environments.
To achieve this, we are planning to experiment with multiple machine learning models,
from traditional classifiers to modern deep learning architectures. Each approach is to be
tested to identify its strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that our model is both accurate
and computationally efficient. Key optimizations, such as feature extraction and noise
reduction techniques, are to be incorporated to enhance performance.

Once the model is trained, it has to undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure reliability
in real-world scenarios. Various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score were used to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, real-world testing was
conducted using diverse datasets to verify the model’s adaptability.
Deployment was the final step, where the best-performing model was integrated into
a real-time processing framework. Ensuring seamless integration and testing the system
in practical settings helped validate its usability for real-world applications.


**Data Collection & Preprocessing**

To ensure a robust evaluation, we will utilize the following high-quality datasets:
• Librispeech – Speech data.
• UrbanSound8K – Urban noise classification.
• AudioSet – General sound event recognition.
Preprocessing Steps:
• Standardize all audio files to a 16kHz sampling rate (mono-channel format).
• Apply noise reduction, normalization, and augmentation techniques.
• Extract meaningful audio features such as MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients) and Mel-Spectrograms.

**Model Implementation**

We will implement and evaluate both deep learning-based and traditional machine learning-
based segmentation models:

Deep Learning-Based Approaches:
• YOHO-based CNN model for direct boundary regression.
• E2E Segmenter for end-to-end segmentation and ASR integration.
Classical Machine Learning Approach:
• SVM Classifier with optimized feature extraction techniques.

**Model Training & Evaluation**

Training Process:
• Utilize high-performance computing (GPU acceleration) for deep learning
model training.
• Perform hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
• Augment dataset using synthetic variations to improve generalization.
Evaluation Metrics:
• Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure segmentation effectiveness.
• Computational efficiency for real-time execution.
• Comparative analysis of deep learning vs. classical machine learning approaches.

**Expected Outcomes**

This project is expected to yield the following results:
• Comprehensive comparison of segmentation models, highlighting their strengths
and weaknesses.

• Development of an optimized segmentation pipeline that achieves high ac-
curacy.

• Deployment of a real-time web-based application for speech and non-speech
segmentation.
• Insights into future improvements in audio segmentation technology.
